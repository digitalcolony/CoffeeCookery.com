        <h1>CoffeeCookery Is Gone</h1>

        <p>CoffeeCookery was a 5-month experiment to see if
            <a href="https://ineedcoffee.com">INeedCoffee.com</a> could spin-off a recipe site. It didn't work out for various reasons, including lack of time.
            The recipes that were on this site have been returned to INeedCoffee.
